## Abstract

Shape displays which actively manipulate surface geometry are an expanding robotics domain with applications to haptics, manufacturing, aerodynamics,
andmore. However, existing displays often lack high-fidelity shape morphing, high-speed deformation, and embedded state sensing, limiting their potential
uses. Here, **we demonstrate a multifunctional soft shape display driven by a 10 Ã— 10 array of scalable cellular units which combine high-speed electrohydraulic
soft actuation, magnetic-based sensing, and control circuitry. We report high-performance reversible shape morphing up to 50 Hz, sensing of
surface deformations with 0.1mm sensitivity and external forces with 50mN sensitivity in each cell, which we demonstrate across a multitude of applications
including user interaction, image display, sensing of object mass, and dynamic manipulation of solids and liquids.** This work showcases the rich multifunctionality and high-performance capabilities that arise from tightlyintegrating large numbers of electrohydraulic actuators, soft sensors, and
controllers at a previously undemonstrated scale in soft robotics.
