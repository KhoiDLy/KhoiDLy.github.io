We believe the transition from robots as recipients of human instruction to robots as capable collaborators hinges around the implementation of **transparent systems**, where mental models about the task are shared between peers, and the human partner is freed from the responsibility of taking care of both actors.
In this work, we implement a transparent task planner able to be deployed in realistic, near-future applications. The proposed framework is capable of basic reasoning capabilities for what concerns role assignment and task allocation, and it interfaces with the human partner at the level of abstraction he is most comfortable with. The system is readily available to non-expert users, and programmable with high-level commands in an intuitive interface. Our results demonstrate an overall improvement in terms of completion time, as well as a reduced cognitive load for the human partner.

The **Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) model set** is intended to ease the design of human-robot collaboration experiments.
It targets scenarios like the collaborative assembly of furniture, and consists of a combination of standard components and custom designs, that are:

 * A series of eight 3D printed brackets
 * Dowels
 * Plywood
 * Fasteners (Screws)

The model set aims at reducing the amount of work required to set up and reproduce HRC experiments.
It is designed to be modular, extendable, and easy to distribute. All the content of this repository is distributed under the [Creative Commons attribution-sharealike 4.0 international public license (CC-by-sa)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).

## 3D Printed Brackets

The 3D Printed Brackets were designed with three main criteria in mind : re-use, replicability, and modularity.


The `.stl` files and the SolidWorks files can be found in the [`Bracket STL Files`](https://github.com/ScazLab/HRC-model-set/tree/master/Bracket%20STL%20Files) and [`Bracket SolidWorks Files`](https://github.com/ScazLab/HRC-model-set/tree/master/Bracket%20SolidWorks%20Files) sub-folders respectively.

For more information on how to customize the brackets, please visit [here](https://scazlab.github.io/HRC-model-set/info/how-to-customize/).

## Configurations

We present [four](https://scazlab.github.io/HRC-model-set/configurations/renderings/) prototypical objects built using different configurations of the hardware mentioned above.

Our designs range from the most simple, the Table configuration, to quite complex, the Console configuration.

## 3D Printing

Each bracket is modeled in SolidWorks and then printed on a Dimension Elite FDM printer using ABS+ plastic.

[Here](https://scazlab.github.io/HRC-model-set/info/3D-printing-recommendations/) are some guidelines to use when printing out a file using some common 3D printers. -->
