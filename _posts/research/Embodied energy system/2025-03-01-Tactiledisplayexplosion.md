## Abstract

High-resolution electronic tactile displays stand to transform haptics for remote machine operation, virtual reality, and digital information access for blind and visually impaired people. Yet, increasing their resolution requires increasing the number of individually addressable actuators while simultaneously reducing their total surface area, power consumption, and weight, challenges most evidently reflected in the dearth of affordable multiline braille displays. Blending principles from soft robotics, microfluidics, and nonlinear mechanics, **we produce a 10x10 array of 2 mm diameter, combustion-powered, evertive soft actuators that repeatably produce display states, with dots rising in 0.24 ms. Our rubber architecture is hermetically sealed and demonstrates resistance to liquid and dirt ingress. Finally, we demonstrate complete actuation cycles in an untethered tactile display prototype.** Our platform technology extends the capabilities of tactile displays to environments currently inaccessible to traditional actuation modalities.
