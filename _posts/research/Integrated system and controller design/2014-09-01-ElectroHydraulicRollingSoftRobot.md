Rolling robots are attractive due to their simple uniform designs, high degree of mobility, dynamic stability, and self-recovery from collision. In these designs, soft-shell rolling robots are advantageous compared to traditional rigid-shell rolling robots thanks to their ability to absorb and diffuse impact energy upon collision and their conformity to rough terrains. Despite previous efforts to design shell-bulging rolling soft robots, pneumatic and other soft actuators are often limited in terms of high-speed dynamics. Furthermore, mathematical description of the rolling behavior of this type of robot and how these robots can regulate their rolling speed are not mentioned. To address the above research limitations, this paper introduces a cylindrical-shaped shell-bulging rolling soft robot that employs an array of 16 folded-HASEL actuators as a mean for fast and efficient rolling. The actuators represent the soft components that exert forces on the ground to generate locomotion. In this work, we not only **demonstrate its ability to carry integrated hardware (total weight of 0.979 kg) but also a rolling maximum speed at 0.7 m/s (1.56 mph), allowing the robot to outperform the existing rolling soft robot with similar weight and size.** This work serves as the **foreground of electromechanical design, hybrid dynamic modeling, and model predictive control for a high-speed electro-hydraulic mobile soft robotic system.**
