## Technical Debt Analysis

### Critical Technical Debt Items

#### 1. CSS Architecture Debt
**Current State**: Monolithic `main.css` (1600+ lines)
**Issues**:
- Mixing Bootstrap overrides with custom styles
- No modular organization
- Difficult maintenance and debugging
- Performance impact from unminified CSS

**Remediation Strategy**:
- Implement CSS module architecture
- Separate Bootstrap customizations from component styles
- Add CSS minification and optimization
- Create style guide documentation

#### 2. Content Organization Debt
**Current State**: Mixed content structure across directories
**Issues**:
- Research projects split between `_posts/research/` subdirectories
- Inconsistent front matter patterns
- Hardcoded image paths in templates
- Complex conditional rendering logic

**Remediation Strategy**:
- Standardize content structure and front matter
- Implement dynamic image path resolution
- Create content templates and validation
- Simplify conditional rendering logic

#### 3. Navigation Architecture Debt
**Current State**: Hardcoded navigation with complex conditionals
**Issues**:
- Navigation logic embedded in `_includes/header.html`
- Complex page type conditionals
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- No dynamic menu generation

**Remediation Strategy**:
- Implement data-driven navigation system
- Create navigation configuration in YAML
- Simplify page type logic
- Add breadcrumb and search functionality

#### 4. Asset Management Debt
**Current State**: Local asset hosting with manual optimization
**Issues**:
- No automated image optimization
- Multiple font weights loaded simultaneously
- No lazy loading for portfolio images
- Manual asset management processes

**Remediation Strategy**:
- Implement automated image optimization pipeline
- Optimize font loading strategy
- Add lazy loading for images
- Create asset management automation

### Performance Debt Analysis

#### Current Performance Bottlenecks
1. **CSS Loading**: Large unminified CSS file impacts initial page load
2. **Font Loading**: Multiple Montserrat weights loaded simultaneously
3. **Image Loading**: No lazy loading for portfolio images
4. **JavaScript Loading**: Multiple jQuery plugins loaded on every page

#### Performance Optimization Strategy
- Implement critical CSS inlining
- Optimize font loading with font-display: swap
- Add image lazy loading and WebP conversion
- Implement JavaScript code splitting and lazy loading
