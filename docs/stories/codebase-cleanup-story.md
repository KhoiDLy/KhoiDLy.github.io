# Codebase Cleanup - Remove Unused Example Files - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a maintainer and developer of the KhoiDLy.github.io academic portfolio site,
I want to remove all example files that are not used anywhere in the actual codebase,
So that the repository is clean, easier to navigate, maintain, and understand for future development.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Jekyll static site generator build process and GitHub Pages deployment
- Technology: Jekyll, Markdown, YAML, HTML/CSS/JS, GitHub Pages
- Follows pattern: File removal without affecting Jekyll processing or site generation
- Touch points: File system structure, potential references in templates or includes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
1. All unused example files are identified and removed from the repository
2. Jekyll build process continues to work without errors
3. Static website generates identically to the previous version

### Integration Requirements:
4. Existing Jekyll site generation continues to work unchanged
5. GitHub Pages deployment process maintains current behavior
6. All active content (research projects, publications, CV data) remains accessible

### Quality Requirements:
7. No broken links or missing references in the generated site
8. Repository structure is cleaner and more navigable
9. No regression in existing functionality verified through testing

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** File system cleanup that doesn't affect Jekyll's content processing pipeline
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Standard Jekyll file organization (content in `_posts`, `_data`, `_includes`, etc.)
- **Key Constraints:** Must preserve all actively used files and maintain identical site functionality

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met
- [x] Integration requirements verified
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Jekyll build completes successfully
- [x] Generated site matches previous version exactly
- [x] No broken links or missing assets
- [x] Repository structure is cleaner and more maintainable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Minimal Risk Assessment:
- **Primary Risk:** Accidentally removing files that are referenced by Jekyll templates or includes
- **Mitigation:** Careful analysis of file references before deletion, testing Jekyll build after each batch of removals
- **Rollback:** Git version control allows easy restoration of accidentally deleted files

### Compatibility Verification:
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs (Jekyll build process)
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only (N/A - no database)
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns (no UI changes)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible (removing files improves performance)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: File Analysis and Identification
- Analyze repository structure to identify potentially unused files
- Check for references to example files in Jekyll templates and includes
- Categorize files by type and usage status
- Create backup of files before deletion

### Phase 2: Safe File Removal
- Remove unused example files in small batches
- Test Jekyll build after each batch removal
- Verify no broken links or missing references
- Commit changes with descriptive commit messages

### Phase 3: Verification and Testing
- Run complete Jekyll build process
- Verify generated site matches previous version exactly
- Test all pages and functionality
- Document cleanup results

### Phase 4: Documentation Update
- Update repository documentation if needed
- Document cleanup process for future reference
- Update any relevant README or maintenance documentation

## Current System Analysis

**Repository Structure:**
- `_posts/` - Content files (research, blog, design, cv)
- `_data/` - YAML data files for CV and site configuration
- `_includes/` - Jekyll includes and templates
- `_layouts/` - Jekyll layout templates
- `img/` - Image assets and portfolio files
- `js/` - JavaScript files
- `fonts/` - Font files
- `papers/` - Academic publications
- `docs/` - Documentation files

**Potential Cleanup Targets:**
- Unused example files in various directories
- Duplicate or outdated asset files
- Unused template files or includes
- Example configuration files not in use

## Success Criteria

The story creation is successful when:

1. Enhancement is clearly defined and appropriately scoped for single session
2. Integration approach is straightforward and low-risk
3. Existing system patterns are identified and will be followed
4. Rollback plan is simple and feasible
5. Acceptance criteria include existing functionality verification

## Notes

- This story focuses on maintenance and cleanup rather than feature development
- All changes should preserve existing site functionality completely
- Leverages Git's version control for safe rollback if needed
- Improves repository maintainability without affecting user experience
- Aligns with technical debt reduction goals identified in architecture analysis

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - The cleanup implementation demonstrates thorough analysis and safe execution. All identified unused example files have been properly removed without affecting the active codebase. The developer followed best practices by:

- Conducting comprehensive file reference analysis before deletion
- Verifying no references existed in Jekyll templates or includes
- Using Git version control for safe rollback capability
- Documenting all changes clearly in the Dev Agent Record

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring required** - The implementation was clean and followed proper procedures. The file deletion process was executed safely without requiring code improvements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ No coding standards applicable for file deletion
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Repository structure improved by removing unused files
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Manual verification completed successfully
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified file reference checking completed before deletion
- [x] Confirmed no broken links or missing references
- [x] Validated repository structure improvement
- [x] Documented all changes in Dev Agent Record
- [x] Maintained Git history for rollback capability

### Security Review

**No security concerns** - File deletion operation was safe and did not affect any security-related files or configurations.

### Performance Considerations

**Positive impact** - Removing unused files improves repository performance by reducing:
- Repository size and clone time
- File system navigation complexity
- Build process overhead

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified during review** - All cleanup work was completed by the Dev Agent. The review process verified the work was done correctly.

### Gate Status

**Gate**: PASS → docs/qa/gates/codebase-cleanup-story-gate.yml
