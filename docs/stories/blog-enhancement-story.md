# Enhanced Blog Management & Content Creation - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a content creator,
I want improved blog management features and better content creation workflow,
So that I can publish and manage blog posts more efficiently.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing Jekyll blog system (`_posts/blog/`, `_posts/research/`, `_posts/design/`)
- Technology: Jekyll, Liquid templating, existing markdown workflow
- Follows pattern: Jekyll's built-in blog and post management patterns
- Touch points: `_config.yml` defaults, existing post structure, `_drafts/` folder

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
1. Add draft post management with preview functionality
2. Implement post scheduling capabilities using Jekyll's future-dated posts
3. Add post categories and tags management interface
4. Enhance post metadata management (excerpt, featured images, etc.)

### Integration Requirements:
4. Existing blog functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New features follow Jekyll's standard post management patterns
6. Integration with existing `_posts/` structure maintains current behavior

### Quality Requirements:
7. Draft posts are properly excluded from production builds
8. Post metadata is consistently applied across all post types
9. No regression in existing blog functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing Jekyll configuration and add helper scripts for content management
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Jekyll's built-in `_drafts/` folder and future-dated posts
- **Key Constraints:** Must work with existing GitHub Pages deployment and Jekyll build process

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Draft post workflow implemented and tested
- [ ] Post scheduling functionality working
- [ ] Enhanced metadata management for posts
- [ ] Content creation helper scripts added
- [ ] Existing blog functionality regression tested
- [ ] Documentation updated for new workflow

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Minimal Risk Assessment:
- **Primary Risk:** Changes to post structure could affect existing posts
- **Mitigation:** Use additive changes only, test with existing posts
- **Rollback:** Simple git revert of configuration changes

### Compatibility Verification:
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing post structure
- [ ] New features are additive only
- [ ] Works with existing GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Draft Management Enhancement
- Create `_drafts/` folder structure if not exists
- Add draft post templates
- Configure Jekyll to properly handle drafts
- Test draft exclusion from production builds

### Phase 2: Post Scheduling
- Implement future-dated post functionality
- Add post scheduling documentation
- Create helper scripts for post creation with future dates
- Test scheduled post publishing

### Phase 3: Enhanced Metadata
- Add excerpt generation for posts
- Implement featured image handling
- Add tags and categories management
- Create post templates with enhanced front matter

### Phase 4: Content Creation Tools
- Create helper scripts for new post creation
- Add post validation scripts
- Implement content management documentation
- Test complete workflow

## Current System Analysis

**Existing Blog Structure:**
- `_posts/blog/` - General blog posts
- `_posts/research/` - Research-related posts with subcategories
- `_posts/design/` - Design-related posts
- `_posts/cv/` - CV-related posts
- `_posts/hidden/` - Hidden posts category

**Existing Configuration:**
- Sophisticated categorization system in `_config.yml`
- Default front matter configuration for different post types
- Existing draft support configured

## Success Criteria

The story creation is successful when:

1. Enhancement is clearly defined and appropriately scoped for single session
2. Integration approach is straightforward and low-risk
3. Existing system patterns are identified and will be followed
4. Rollback plan is simple and feasible
5. Acceptance criteria include existing functionality verification

## Notes

- This story builds upon existing Jekyll blog infrastructure
- Focus is on improving workflow rather than changing core functionality
- All changes should be backward compatible with existing posts
- Leverages Jekyll's built-in features rather than external dependencies
