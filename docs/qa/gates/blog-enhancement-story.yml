## Gate Decision: CONCERNS

**Rationale**: One high-risk item (OPS-001) requires mitigation before production deployment.

## Risk Summary

```yaml
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 1
    medium: 2
    low: 3
  highest:
    id: OPS-001
    score: 6
    title: 'GitHub Pages Build Failures'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement staged deployment with build validation'
      - 'Add GitHub Actions build simulation'
      - 'Test rollback procedures'
    monitor:
      - 'Monitor GitHub Pages build success rates'
      - 'Track scheduled post publication accuracy'
```

## Required Actions Before Production

1. **High Priority**: Implement build validation pipeline
2. **Medium Priority**: Test configuration changes incrementally
3. **Low Priority**: Validate scheduling functionality

## Testing Requirements

- Local Jekyll build validation
- GitHub Pages build simulation
- Regression testing of existing posts
- Scheduled post functionality testing

## Risk Score: 78/100

**Assessment**: Manageable risks with proper mitigation strategies in place.
