  - Given: Jekyll site with files removed
  - When: Running `jekyll build` command
  - Then: Build completes without errors
  - Gap: No automated verification of build success

#### AC3: Static website generates identically to the previous version

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Manual Comparison**: Visual inspection of generated site
  - Given: Previous site version and new site version
  - When: Comparing generated HTML and assets
  - Then: Site structure and content remain identical
  - Gap: No automated diff comparison implemented

#### AC4: Existing Jekyll site generation continues to work unchanged

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: Jekyll build process verification
  - Given: Jekyll configuration and templates
  - When: Running site generation process
  - Then: All pages generate correctly with same content
  - Gap: No automated integration test suite

#### AC5: GitHub Pages deployment process maintains current behavior

**Coverage: NONE**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Gap**: No automated deployment testing
- **Suggested Test**: GitHub Actions workflow verification
  - Given: Repository with cleanup changes
  - When: Pushing to main branch
  - Then: GitHub Pages deployment succeeds and site is accessible

#### AC6: All active content (research projects, publications, CV data) remains accessible

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Manual Content Check**: Verification of active content files
  - Given: Active content files in repository
  - When: Checking file system and Jekyll processing
  - Then: All research, publications, and CV data remain accessible
  - Gap: No automated content accessibility testing

#### AC7: No broken links or missing references in the generated site

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Manual Link Check**: `html-proofer` tool usage
  - Given: Generated Jekyll site
  - When: Running `htmlproofer --only-4xx --checks-to-ignore ImageCheck,ScriptCheck ./_site/`
  - Then: No broken links or missing references detected
  - Gap: Not integrated into automated testing pipeline

#### AC8: Repository structure is cleaner and more navigable

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **File System Verification**: Directory structure inspection
  - Given: Repository before and after cleanup
  - When: Comparing directory structure
  - Then: Unused files removed, structure is cleaner
  - Coverage: Manual verification completed

#### AC9: No regression in existing functionality verified through testing

**Coverage: NONE**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Gap**: No comprehensive regression testing implemented
- **Suggested Test**: Automated functionality verification
  - Given: Site with all existing functionality
  - When: After file cleanup operations
  - Then: All existing features continue to work correctly

### Critical Gaps

1. **Automated Testing Infrastructure**
   - Gap: No automated test suite for Jekyll site
   - Risk: High - Manual testing prone to human error
   - Action: Implement automated build verification and link checking

2. **Deployment Testing**
   - Gap: No automated GitHub Pages deployment verification
   - Risk: Medium - Deployment failures may go undetected
   - Action: Add GitHub Actions workflow for deployment testing

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Gap: No systematic regression testing for existing functionality
   - Risk: Medium - Changes may break existing features
   - Action: Implement automated regression test suite

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Automated Build Testing**
   - Implement GitHub Actions workflow for Jekyll build verification
   - Add automated link checking with html-proofer
   - Create automated site generation comparison

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test Jekyll template processing with sample content
   - Verify YAML data file processing
   - Test all page types (home, blog, portfolio, CV)

3. **Deployment Testing**
   - Automated GitHub Pages deployment verification
   - Site accessibility testing after deployment
   - Performance regression testing

4. **Content Integrity Testing**
   - Automated verification of active content preservation
   - Test all research project and publication links
   - Verify CV data integrity

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Requirements with no coverage (AC5, AC9)
- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with only partial coverage (AC2, AC3, AC4, AC6, AC7)
- **Low Risk**: Requirements with full coverage (AC1, AC8)

### Test Environment Requirements

#### Current Testing Infrastructure
- **Manual Testing**: Primary QA method
- **html-proofer**: Available for link checking (not automated)
- **Jekyll Build**: Manual build verification
- **Git**: Version control for rollback capability

#### Recommended Testing Infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **html-proofer**: Integrated link checking
- **Automated Build**: Jekyll build verification
- **Deployment Testing**: GitHub Pages integration testing

### Quality Indicators

Current traceability shows:
- ✅ Every AC has at least manual verification
- ❌ Critical paths lack automated testing
- ❌ Edge cases not systematically covered
- ❌ NFRs without specific automated tests
- ✅ Clear documentation of what was tested

### Red Flags Identified

- ACs with no automated test coverage (AC5, AC9)
- Manual testing as primary verification method
- No automated regression testing
- Deployment process not verified automatically
- Link checking not integrated into pipeline

### Integration with Gates

This traceability feeds into quality gates:
- Critical gaps (AC5, AC9) → CONCERNS
- Partial coverage gaps → CONCERNS
- Manual testing dependency → CONCERNS

**Gate Decision Impact**: CONCERNS - Automated testing infrastructure needed for PASS
