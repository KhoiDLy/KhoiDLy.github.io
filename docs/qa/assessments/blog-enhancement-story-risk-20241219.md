## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 2
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 78/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified - all risks are manageable with proper mitigation.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 0 risks (0 critical)
- Performance: 0 risks (0 critical)
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Business: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Operational: 1 risk (1 high)

### By Component

- Jekyll Configuration: 2 risks
- GitHub Pages Deployment: 1 risk
- Post Management: 2 risks
- Content Workflow: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|-------|----------|
| OPS-001 | GitHub Pages Build Failures | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| TECH-001 | Jekyll Configuration Conflicts | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| TECH-003 | Future-Dated Post Scheduling Failures | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| TECH-002 | Draft Folder Integration Issues | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| DATA-001 | Post Metadata Corruption | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| BUS-001 | Content Creator Workflow Disruption | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **GitHub Pages Build Validation**
  - Local Jekyll build testing
  - GitHub Actions build simulation
  - Production deployment verification
  - Rollback procedure testing

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **Configuration Integration Testing**
  - Incremental configuration validation
  - Existing functionality regression tests
  - Post structure compatibility verification

- **Scheduling Functionality Testing**
  - Future-dated post simulation
  - Time-based publication testing
  - Manual override procedure validation

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **Standard Functional Tests**
  - Draft post workflow testing
  - Metadata management verification
  - Content creation tool validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score â‰¥ 6) must be mitigated
- GitHub Pages build failures must be prevented

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Low-impact risks with documented mitigation strategies
- Risks with clear rollback procedures

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- GitHub Pages build success rates
- Scheduled post publication accuracy
- Draft post exclusion verification
- Configuration change impact assessment

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Jekyll version updates
- GitHub Pages configuration changes
- New post types or categories added
- Build process modifications
- Deployment pipeline changes

## Risk Mitigation Summary

### High Priority Mitigations

1. **OPS-001**: Implement staged deployment with build validation
2. **TECH-001**: Use incremental configuration changes with testing
3. **TECH-003**: Add scheduling validation and monitoring

### Testing Focus Areas

1. **Build Process**: Comprehensive build validation testing
2. **Configuration**: Incremental change validation
3. **Scheduling**: Time-based functionality testing
4. **Regression**: Existing functionality preservation

## Overall Assessment

This story presents **manageable risks** with a risk score of 78/100. The primary concern is GitHub Pages build stability, which can be mitigated through proper testing and staged deployment. The additive nature of changes reduces overall risk exposure.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation using staged deployment and comprehensive testing strategy.
