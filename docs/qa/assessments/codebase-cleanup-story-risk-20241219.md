## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001 | Accidental deletion of referenced files | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| TECH-002 | Jekyll build process failure | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-003 | Broken internal links and references | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001 | Git history pollution from cleanup commits | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| OPS-002 | Documentation inconsistency after cleanup | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| DATA-001 | Loss of historical example files | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**: File reference validation tests
  - Automated scan for all file references in templates, includes, and posts
  - Pre-deletion validation script to check file usage
  - Post-deletion verification of Jekyll build success

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-003**: Link integrity tests
  - Automated link checking for internal references
  - Manual verification of portfolio and publication links
  - Cross-reference validation between posts and assets

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-002**: Build process tests
  - Jekyll build verification after each cleanup batch
  - Site generation comparison with previous version
  - GitHub Pages deployment verification

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: Accidental deletion of referenced files
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Create comprehensive file reference mapping before deletion
- Implement automated reference checking script
- Use Git branches for safe experimentation
- Test Jekyll build after each batch of deletions
**Testing Requirements**:
- Automated file reference scanning
- Jekyll build verification tests
- Manual review of critical template files
**Residual Risk**: Low - Automated checks provide safety net
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Before any file deletion

### TECH-003: Broken internal links and references
**Strategy**: Detective
**Actions**:
- Implement link checking automation
- Manual verification of critical paths
- Use Jekyll's built-in link validation
**Testing Requirements**:
- Automated link checking tests
- Manual navigation testing
- Cross-reference validation
**Residual Risk**: Low - Multiple validation layers
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: During cleanup process

### TECH-002: Jekyll build process failure
**Strategy**: Corrective
**Actions**:
- Incremental cleanup approach
- Immediate rollback capability via Git
- Build verification after each change
**Testing Requirements**:
- Jekyll build tests
- Site generation comparison
- Deployment verification
**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Git provides easy rollback
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Continuous during cleanup

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6) must be mitigated
- TECH-001 requires automated reference checking

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks (score 4) with automated validation
- Low risks (score 2-3) with manual verification

### Accepted Risks

- OPS-001 and OPS-002 are acceptable as they don't affect functionality
- DATA-001 is acceptable as example files are not critical content

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Jekyll build success rates
- Site generation performance
- Broken link detection
- File system integrity

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New file types are identified for cleanup
- Jekyll configuration changes
- Template or include modifications
- Significant repository structure changes

## Risk-Based Recommendations

Based on risk profile, recommend:

1. **Testing Priority**
   - Start with automated file reference scanning
   - Implement incremental cleanup with build verification
   - Use comprehensive link checking

2. **Development Focus**
   - Create reference mapping before any deletions
   - Use Git branches for safe experimentation
   - Implement automated validation scripts

3. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Phased cleanup approach (small batches)
   - Immediate rollback capability
   - Continuous build verification

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Jekyll build success monitoring
   - Link integrity checking
   - File system change tracking
