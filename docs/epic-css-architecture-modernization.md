| **Epic ID** | EPIC-001 |
| **Created Date** | 2024-12-19 |
| **Author** | John (Product Manager) |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Related Documents** | [Brownfield Architecture](./brownfield-architecture-enhanced.md), [Brownfield PRD](./brownfield-prd.md) |

## Epic Goal

Modernize the monolithic CSS architecture (1600+ lines in main.css) into a modular, maintainable system while preserving all existing functionality and visual design. This enhancement will improve development efficiency, reduce maintenance overhead, and establish a scalable foundation for future CSS development.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current Relevant Functionality:**
- Jekyll-based static academic portfolio website
- Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta framework with extensive custom overrides
- Complex navigation system with conditional rendering
- Research project showcases, publication listings, and CV display
- Responsive design supporting mobile and desktop views

**Technology Stack:**
- Jekyll 4.x static site generator
- Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta CSS framework
- jQuery 3.2.1 for DOM manipulation
- Montserrat font family (local hosting)
- GitHub Pages deployment

**Integration Points:**
- All existing templates (`_layouts/default.html`)
- Include files (`_includes/header.html`, `_includes/footer.html`, etc.)
- Layout components and navigation system
- Asset management and font loading

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Added/Changed:**
- Modular CSS architecture replacing monolithic main.css
- Separated Bootstrap customizations from component styles
- Organized CSS modules (base, layout, components, utilities)
- CSS minification and optimization pipeline
- Style guide documentation

**How It Integrates:**
- Maintains existing CSS class names and selectors
- Preserves Bootstrap framework compatibility
- Gradual migration approach with feature flags
- Automated build process integration

**Success Criteria:**
- CSS maintainability improved (modular organization)
- Development velocity increased (easier debugging and updates)
- Performance optimized (minified CSS, reduced file size)
- Visual design preserved (no regression in appearance)
- Documentation complete (style guide and guidelines)

## Stories

### Story 1: CSS Architecture Analysis and Planning
**Story Title:** Audit Current CSS Usage and Create Migration Plan
**Story Description:** Analyze the existing 1600+ line main.css file, identify usage patterns, categorize styles, and create a detailed migration plan for modular architecture.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete audit of main.css file completed
- [ ] CSS usage patterns documented across all templates
- [ ] Style categories identified (base, layout, components, utilities)
- [ ] Migration plan created with risk assessment
- [ ] Backup strategy established

### Story 2: Core CSS Module Implementation
**Story Title:** Implement Modular CSS Architecture
**Story Description:** Create the new modular CSS structure with base styles, layout modules, and component styles while maintaining existing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Base CSS module created (typography, colors, variables)
- [ ] Layout modules implemented (grid, navigation, page structure)
- [ ] Component modules created (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
- [ ] Bootstrap customizations separated and organized
- [ ] CSS build process established

### Story 3: CSS Integration and Validation
**Story Title:** Integrate Modules and Validate Functionality
**Story Description:** Integrate the new CSS modules into the existing system, validate all functionality, and ensure no visual regression.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CSS modules integrated into Jekyll build process
- [ ] All existing pages render correctly
- [ ] Responsive design maintained across devices
- [ ] Performance optimization implemented (minification)
- [ ] Visual regression testing completed

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] **Existing APIs remain unchanged** - All CSS class names and selectors preserved
- [ ] **Database schema changes are backward compatible** - N/A (static site)
- [ ] **UI changes follow existing patterns** - Bootstrap framework compatibility maintained
- [ ] **Performance impact is minimal** - CSS optimization reduces file size and load time

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk: Breaking Existing Visual Design
**Risk Description:** CSS refactoring may introduce visual regressions or break existing layouts
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Comprehensive visual regression testing
- Gradual migration approach with feature flags
- Maintain parallel CSS systems during transition
- Automated testing for critical visual elements

### Secondary Risk: Build Process Disruption
**Risk Description:** Changes to CSS build process may break GitHub Pages deployment
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Test build process in development environment
- Maintain compatibility with GitHub Pages constraints
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Document build process changes

### Rollback Plan
- Maintain complete backup of original main.css file
- Git-based rollback capability for all changes
- Ability to revert to original CSS structure within 1 hour
- Documented rollback procedures for team

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **All stories completed** with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] **Existing functionality verified** through comprehensive testing
- [ ] **Integration points working correctly** - all templates and includes functional
- [ ] **Documentation updated appropriately** - style guide and guidelines created
- [ ] **No regression in existing features** - visual and functional parity maintained
- [ ] **Performance improvements achieved** - CSS file size reduced, load time optimized
- [ ] **Team training completed** - developers understand new CSS architecture

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **CSS File Size**: Reduced by at least 20% through optimization
- **Build Time**: No increase in Jekyll build time
- **Maintainability**: CSS organization score improved (measured by complexity metrics)
- **Performance**: Page load time maintained or improved

### Development Metrics
- **Development Velocity**: Faster CSS debugging and updates
- **Code Quality**: Improved CSS organization and documentation
- **Team Productivity**: Reduced time for CSS-related tasks
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Team understanding of CSS architecture

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Jekyll build process and GitHub Pages compatibility
- Existing template and include file structure
- Current asset management system

### External Dependencies
- Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta framework
- GitHub Pages deployment system
- Browser compatibility requirements

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Story 1:** 3-4 days (Analysis and Planning)
**Story 2:** 5-7 days (Implementation)
**Story 3:** 3-4 days (Integration and Validation)

## Notes

- This epic focuses specifically on CSS architecture modernization
- Maintains compatibility with existing Jekyll and Bootstrap setup
- Establishes foundation for future CSS development
- Prioritizes system integrity over new functionality
- Follows brownfield enhancement principles

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing Jekyll-based academic portfolio website running Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta
- Integration points: All existing templates, includes, and layout files depend on current CSS structure
- Existing patterns to follow: Bootstrap framework, current class naming conventions, responsive design patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Preserve all existing CSS class names, selectors, and visual design
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering improved CSS maintainability and development efficiency. Focus on gradual migration approach to minimize risk to existing functionality."
