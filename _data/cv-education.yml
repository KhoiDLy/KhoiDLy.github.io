   description: "By and large, my Ph.D. research had three core contributions: i) I implemented a bio-inspired approach able to <i>integrate multisensory information</i> into a cohesive representation of the nearby space of a robot; ii) I demonstrated for the first time how novel <i>touch sensing technologies</i> can be exploited to dramatically increase the amount of information available to a robot; iii) I provided a compelling use case for this technology, in that I proved how, by imbuing a robot with local information about its nearby space, a <i>distributed robot controller</i> can be implemented that is capable of significantly enhancing the interaction capabilities of a robot with its environment. More precisely, I improved the sensorimotor capabilities of the <i>iCub</i> humanoid with a system able to learn a multisensory representation of the space around the robot's body (or peripersonal space, PPS). The robot, equipped with a whole-body artificial skin, learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a tactile-motor and tactile-visual representation. The peripersonal space model I implemented has the unique capability of extending the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it implicitly copes with modeling or calibration errors. This feature has been then exploited with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot. That is, an avoidance and reaching controller capable of <i>using any body part in order to either move away from or seek contact with</i> nearby objects."

   description: "I used <i>SVM</i>s to train a <i>PUMA</i> robotic arm how to be the goalkeeper in an air hockey game. The robot observed which of the previously experienced puck trajectories scored a point. Based on this, it learned how to prevent such scores by predicting the final outcome of a trajectory from its first 30ms. Its success rate was beyond <i>95%</i>."
