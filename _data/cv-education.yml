   description: "Soft robotics is a field of robotic system design characterized by materials and structures that exhibit large-scale deformation, high compliance, and rich multifunctionality. The incorporation of soft and deformable structures endows soft robotic systems with the compliance and resiliency that makes them well-adapted for unstructured and dynamic environments. While actuation mechanisms for soft robots vary widely, soft electrostatic transducers such as dielectric elastomer actuators and electro-hydraulic actuators have demonstrated promise due to their muscle-like performance. Despite significant leaps in design and modeling of electro-hydraulic actuators thus far, the applications based on these novel actuators are often limited to tethered systems that require bulky and high-cost external sensors and controllers. To address the mentioned shortcomings, this body of research has enabled embedded perception and intelligence to electromechanical systems driven by electro-hydraulic actuators, by (i) developing capacitive self-sensing and magnetic sensing techniques to estimate shape changes of electro-hydraulic actuators in real-time; (ii) designing, modeling, and implementing a controller for a mobile soft robot driven by electro-hydraulic actuators; and (iii) proposing a contact force estimator for the robot using an onboard inertial measurement unit and magnetic displacement sensors. This work represents a substantial step to bring soft robotics closer to practical, real-world applications."

   description: "I used <i>SVM</i>s to train a <i>PUMA</i> robotic arm how to be the goalkeeper in an air hockey game. The robot observed which of the previously experienced puck trajectories scored a point. Based on this, it learned how to prevent such scores by predicting the final outcome of a trajectory from its first 30ms. Its success rate was beyond <i>95%</i>."
