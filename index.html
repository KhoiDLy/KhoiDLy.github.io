My research interests center around **the development of multi-functional robotic materials and systems that can accomodate increasingly more complex autonomous and intelligent tasks**. 
I envision hybrid of rigid-soft integrated robotic structures inspired by biological systems with practical functionalities that traditional rigid robots cannot achieve.
As the field of soft robotics thus far has emphasized on isolated development of soft actuators, sensors, or stretchable and flexible electronics with limited comprehensive studies regarding the system-level integration and control,
my work focuses on the embedded sensing and control to not only improve the accuracy and precision of novel soft actuators but also better integrate subsystems consisting of actuators, sensors, and computation modules for high-performance robotic applications.
My research direction will allow for tighter integration and improved system-level soft robotic performance while still making the most of decades of rigid-bodied robotics.

**My research bridges the gap between embedded sensing design, actuator design, control theory for hybrid robotic systems.**
Over the years, I have worked on

i) Developing a miniaturized driver circuit for high voltage applications

ii) Developing novel, embedded sensors for a new class of soft, high speed actuators called electro-hydraulic actuators 

iii) Designing, modeling and implementing a hybrid (continuous-discrete) controller for a robotic platform driven by electro-hydraulic actuators

The following is a highlighted list of research projects during my Ph.D (i.e. projects that ended up / will be submitted to in a journal issue or conference proceeding).
