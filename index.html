<!-- My research interests center around **the development of multi-functional robotic materials and cyber-physical systems that can accommodate increasingly more complex intelligent and autonomous tasks**.
I envision hybrid of rigid-soft integrated robotic structures inspired by natural systems with practical functionalities that traditional robots fail to achieve.
As the field of soft robotics thus far has emphasized on isolated development of soft actuators, sensors, or stretchable and flexible electronics
with limited comprehensive studies regarding the system-level integration, communication, and control, my work aims to address the issues of embedded and integrated designs to not only improve
the accuracy and precision of novel soft actuators but also better integrate subsystems consisting of actuators, sensors, and computation modules for high-performance robotic applications.
My research direction will allow for tighter integration and improved system-level soft robotic performance while still capitalizing on decades of rigid-bodied robotics.

**My research bridges the gap between embedded sensing design, actuator design, and control theory for hybrid robotic systems.**
Over the years, I have played a key role in:

i) Developing a miniaturized driver circuit for high voltage soft robots

ii) Developing novel embedded sensors for a new class of high-speed, soft actuators called electro-hydraulic actuators

iii) Designing, modeling, and implementing a hybrid (continuous-discrete) controller for a robotic platform driven by electro-hydraulic actuators

The following is a highlighted list of research projects during my Ph.D. -->

**BIO:** I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Organic Robotic Laboratory under Dr. Robert Shepherd. I received a Ph.D degree in Mechanical Engineering at university of Colorado Boulder,
at which I was advised by Dr. Nikolaus Correll at Intelligent Robotics Laboratory and by Dr. Mark Rentschler at Advanced Medical Technology Group. My research interest is in novel mechanisms, embedded sensor designs, and control implementation for
for robotic systems. Over the past years, I have worked on 8 research projects, published 6 research articles, and filed two provisional patent applications.


**My research bridges the gap between embedded sensing design, actuator design, and control theory for hybrid (rigid-soft) robotic systems.**
There are three research areas that I have played a key role in:

i) Developing a miniaturized driver circuit for high voltage soft robots

ii) Developing novel embedded sensors for a new class of high-speed, soft actuators called electro-hydraulic actuators

iii) Designing, modeling, and implementing a hybrid (continuous-discrete) controller for a robotic platform driven by electro-hydraulic actuators
