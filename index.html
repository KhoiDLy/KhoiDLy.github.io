<!-- My research interests center around **the development of multi-functional robotic materials and cyber-physical systems that can accommodate increasingly more complex intelligent and autonomous tasks**.
I envision hybrid of rigid-soft integrated robotic structures inspired by natural systems with practical functionalities that traditional robots fail to achieve.
As the field of soft robotics thus far has emphasized on isolated development of soft actuators, sensors, or stretchable and flexible electronics
with limited comprehensive studies regarding the system-level integration, communication, and control, my work aims to address the issues of embedded and integrated designs to not only improve
the accuracy and precision of novel soft actuators but also better integrate subsystems consisting of actuators, sensors, and computation modules for high-performance robotic applications.
My research direction will allow for tighter integration and improved system-level soft robotic performance while still capitalizing on decades of rigid-bodied robotics.

**My research bridges the gap between embedded sensing design, actuator design, and control theory for hybrid robotic systems.**
Over the years, I have played a key role in:

i) Developing a miniaturized driver circuit for high voltage soft robots

ii) Developing novel embedded sensors for a new class of high-speed, soft actuators called electro-hydraulic actuators

iii) Designing, modeling, and implementing a hybrid (continuous-discrete) controller for a robotic platform driven by electro-hydraulic actuators

The following is a highlighted list of research projects during my Ph.D. -->

**BIO:** Dr. Ly's career interests center around the design and control of tightly integrated, highly nonlinear electromechanical systems using  state-of-the-art actuators, sensors, energy sources, and computational hardware.
He envisions cyber-physical systems with high-speed embedded sensors, actuators, and computational hardware that allows
the robots to handle increasingly complex tasks. Over the past 7 years, he has worked on **10 research projects (6 of which he
created and lead), published 9 research articles (8 of which are high-impact journals), filed 2 U.S. patent (and 1 provisional) applications.** 
 His research extends to practical applications, including artificial muscles, robotic tactile interfaces, and bio-inspired robotic locomotion. As a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Cornell University, he continues pioneering innovative robotic solutions. **In 2024, he has helped secured over \$800,000 in research funding through ARPA-E and DOE grants** to develop an underground digging robot and a distributed wave energy harvester, respectively. Dr. Ly would like to apply knowledge of system designs, specifically in nonlinear robotics, to address the challenges
of aging population around the world by supporting and improving the elderly peopleâ€™s mobility, making the digital world
more tangible and interactive, and improving our opinions of robotics.
