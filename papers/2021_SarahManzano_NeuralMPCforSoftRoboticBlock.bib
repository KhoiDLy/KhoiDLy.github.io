	abstract = {We present a high-bandwidth, lightweight, and nonlinear output tracking technique for soft actuators that combines parsimonious recursive layers for forward output predictions and online optimization using Newton-Raphson. This technique allows for reduced model sizes and increased control loop frequencies when compared with conventional RNN models. Experimental results of this controller prototype on a single soft actuator with soft positional sensors indicate eﬀective tracking of referenced spatial trajectories and rejection of mechanical and electromagnetic disturbances. These are evidenced by root mean squared path tracking errors (RMSE) of 1.8𝑚𝑚 using a fully connected (FC) substructure, 1.62𝑚𝑚 using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and 2.11𝑚𝑚 using a long short term memory (LSTM) unit, all averaged over three tasks. Among these models, the highest ﬂash memory requirement is 2.22𝑘 𝐵 enabling co-location of controller and actuator.},
