                    <p>{{ site.description }} Here you can find some of my exciting, highlighted research and engineering works I have been fortunate to contribute over the years. To me, research has become the profession in which I can exercise my creativity and leadership to the fullest. The rewards—those "Eureka" moments—are equally exhilarating and addictive.

                        Outside of research, I probably spend most of my time training for marathons and reading books. Where else can you find gripping true stories about corporate politics and dramas, bleak fictional apocalyptic worlds, or intriguing interstellar travels better than in well-written, fascinating books about those subjects? Maybe I am mixing up my work and life, but I am always curious about what would happen if I apply some of the ideas from those stories into my daily life.
